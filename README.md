# Chirpy
Chirpy is a server that works alike social media applications, having users, posts (chirps) and even security related measures, such as password encryption with [bcrypt]("golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt") and JWT (Json Web Tokens) for authorization.
## Why?
First of all, to have a better understanding of how http servers work, things like:
* Headers
* Error codes
* URL Queries
* Apis
* Webhooks
